Note on Release date:

The study and its associated data will not become public until the study
release date has expired. The default for a newly registered study is to have a
hold date two months after the submission date. The release date can be as much
as 2 years beyond the present date, and on this day the study and its data will
automatically be made public. Notification of this will be sent in advance to
all email addresses registered with your submission account. You can change the
release date at any time to make it sooner or later, but once the data becomes
public you may not make it private again. See also:
<https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/release.html>

One may also change items 2--4 before the final submission.
