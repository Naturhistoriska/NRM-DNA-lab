Dear All,

Regarding the {XXXX} project:

To be able to process your samples and ensure the preservation of sample
metadata, we kindly ask you to provide the information outlined below.

The link below (password: {YYYYY}) will take you to a project-specific folder
containing the spreadsheet file `ENA_default_sample_checklist_{XXXX}.xlsx`,
together with explanations of the format
(`ENA_default_sample_checklist_README.pdf`).

URL: <https://nrmcloud.nrm.se/s/123456789>

Your task is to fill in as many of the empty cells in the spreadsheet as
possible. Note that some values are mandatory, while others are optional.

In addition, there is a file (`Study_info_{XXXXX}.md`) containing four
pieces of information that also need to be completed and retuned to the NRM-DNA
lab.

Notes:

- The first two columns relate to a scientific name and its corresponding
  taxonomic ID (GenBank taxid). At some point before data submission, this
  column needs to be populated with a valid binomen. Once a binomen is
  provided, we can easily look up the taxid. In taxonomic studies, there are
  often new names that are not yet present in the GenBank database. These need
  to be handled separately.

- In the column labelled `sample_title`, I have previously used a longer name
  that contains as much information as possible while still being useful for
  downstream analyses. For example, you may consider combining `scientific_name`
  + `sample_alias` and perhaps also `specimen_voucher` (if not too complicated):
    `Genus_species_GS01_NRM123`.
